# Advanced Tab Organizer
A search based Chrome extension to organize tabs, windows, and groups.
The idea is to offer a powerful search bar that allows you to act on your tabs.

This extension is for people that uses several (hundreds) of tabs, and needs to
navigate between them.

## How I use it

* To close all YouTube tabs
* To group all tabs that from Github
* To mute a tab
* To close all tabs that matches a string

## How it works

## Issues

**Chrome API doesn't fully support groups**
Despite the documentation saying it works, I wasn't able to find a way to properly
handle groups of tabs, despite the feature being functional for a while now.
