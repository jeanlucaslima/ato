## üöÄ Getting Started

> Requires Chrome with Manifest V3 support.

1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ato-extension.git
   ```
2. Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions.
3. Enable Developer mode in the top-right corner.
4. Click Load unpacked and select the ato-extension directory.
5. Use the shortcut Cmd+U / Ctrl+U to launch ATO from anywhere.

## üß† Good Practices (Development & UX)

Minimal permissions: Request only what's strictly needed ‚Äî tabs, activeTab, storage.

Storage sync: Use chrome.storage.sync for favorites or view mode (optional and private).

Event-driven design: No background memory hogs ‚Äî use service workers and event listeners only.

Visual clarity: Tailor the UI for fast scanning, tab title emphasis, and mouse+keyboard use.

Fail-safe actions: Batch operations (e.g., close all, sleep all) should be undoable or at least confirmable.

Local-first philosophy: No data leaves your machine unless you explicitly export it.

## üì¶ Tech Stack

Chrome Extension Manifest V3

Vanilla JavaScript (or TypeScript)

HTML + TailwindCSS (suggested)

Fuse.js (or similar) for fuzzy search

## üí° Roadmap / Future Ideas

Save tab sessions (name + restore later)

Export open tabs to Markdown / JSON

Smart suggestions for tab cleanup

Usage heatmap (when and how you open tabs)

Integration with tab group colors and names

Public stats: ‚ÄúHow many tabs did I really open today?‚Äù
