# ATO — Advanced Tab Organizer
↳ Kill duplicates. Stay focused. Reclaim your browser.

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-4.0--rebuild-orange.svg)

> **🚧 Branch: v4-rebuild** — This branch is rebuilding ATO from scratch with a minimal, duplicate-focused approach. The v3.0 code is on the `main` branch.

---

## What is v4?

**ATO v4** is a complete reimagining of the tab organizer, stripped down to solve one problem exceptionally well: **managing duplicate tabs**.

Unlike v3's feature-rich sidebar, v4 embraces **minimalism and progressive enhancement**:

- 🎯 **Duplicates First** — Real-time detection with badge count
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Driven** — `Cmd+U` / `Ctrl+U` for instant access
- 🪶 **Ultra Lightweight** — Vanilla JS, no frameworks, zero build step
- 🚀 **Fast & Focused** — Does one thing brilliantly

---

## The Problem

You open a link. Then another. Then you realize you have **5 tabs of the same Wikipedia article** open.

Multiply this by dozens of tabs, and you're drowning in duplicates, wasting memory and losing focus.

**ATO v4 fixes this instantly.**

---

## Features (Phase 1 - MVP)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **🔴 Badge Counter** | Always shows how many duplicate tabs you have |
| **⚡ One-Click Cleanup** | Instantly close all duplicates with one button |
| **⌨️ Keyboard Shortcut** | `Cmd+U` (Mac) or `Ctrl+U` (Win/Linux) to open popup |
| **📋 Duplicate List** | See which tabs are duplicated before closing |
| **🔄 Real-Time Updates** | Badge updates automatically as you browse |

---

## Why Rebuild from Scratch?

**v3 was great, but...**
- Built many features before validating the core need
- Side panel felt heavy for quick actions
- React/Vite added unnecessary complexity
- Easter eggs and extras diluted focus

**v4 philosophy:**
- Start minimal, ship fast, iterate based on real usage
- Solve the most annoying problem first (duplicates)
- Keep it simple: vanilla JS, no build step
- Progressive enhancement: add features only when needed

---

## Development Status

**Current Phase:** Planning → Implementation starting

**Next Steps:**
1. Create `manifest.json` with Manifest V3 config
2. Build background service worker for duplicate detection
3. Implement popup UI (HTML + CSS + JS)
4. Test and polish MVP
5. Ship Phase 1

## Philosophy

> **"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."**
> — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

ATO v4 embodies this principle. Every feature must justify its existence.

**We ask:**
- Does it solve a real pain point?
- Can it be implemented simply?
- Does it align with the minimal philosophy?

If not, it doesn't ship.

---

v4 is in active rebuild. Contributions welcome once Phase 1 MVP is complete.

**Jean Lucas** — Developer, tab-overloader turned duplicate-destroyer

Built with focus, restraint, and a deep desire to make browsing feel better again.

Because 37 tabs isn't the problem — **37 duplicate tabs** is.
